## Description
My goal was to create an employee CMS app that allowed users to view and manage the departments, roles and employees in a company. This would allow users to easily view and update exisiting and new employees.





## Usage
To use the application:

1. Open the repo in your terminal
2. Log into mysql using your credentials
3. Create the db using SOURCE ./db/schema.sql
4. Populate the db using SOURCE ./db/seeds.sql (optional for testing purposes)
5. Run node server.js in your terminal or bash
6. Follow the prompts
